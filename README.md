# Student Management System

This project is a Student Management System built using Java. 
The application allows users to manage a collection of students, including adding, editing, searching, and displaying student information. 
The system also provides options for saving and retrieving student data from a storage medium.

## Features

- **Add Student:** Allows the user to add a new student to the system.
- **Edit Student:** Enables the user to update an existing student's information.
- **Search Student:** Provides functionality to search for a student by roll number or name.
- **Display All Students:** Lists all the students currently in the system.
- **Data Persistence:** Saves student data to a storage medium (e.g., a file or a database) and retrieves it when needed.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format.

## Classes

### 1. `Student`
This class represents an individual student and includes attributes such as:

- `name`: The student's name.
- `rollNumber`: The student's roll number.
- `grade`: The student's grade.
- Additional attributes can be added as needed.

### 2. `StudentManagementSystem`
This class manages the collection of students and provides methods for:

- `addStudent(Student student)`: Adds a new student to the system.
- `removeStudent(String rollNumber)`: Removes a student from the system based on their roll number.
- `searchStudent(String rollNumber)`: Searches for a student by roll number.
- `displayAllStudents()`: Displays all students in the system.
- `saveData()`: Saves the student data to a file or database.
- `loadData()`: Loads the student data from a file or database.

## User Interface

- **Console-Based Interface:** A simple command-line interface where users can interact with the system by entering commands.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** If implemented, the GUI can be built using Java Swing or JavaFX, providing a more user-friendly experience.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Java IDE or a simple text editor
# Running The File

- Compile the Java file: ```javac StudentManagementSystemGUI.java```
- Run the file: ```java StudentManagementSystemGUI```


## Example Usage

   ``` public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StudentManagementSystem sms = new StudentManagementSystem();

        // Adding a new student
        Student student1 = new Student("John Doe", "001", "A");
        sms.addStudent(student1);

        // Displaying all students
        sms.displayAllStudents();

        // Searching for a student
        Student foundStudent = sms.searchStudent("001");
        if (foundStudent != null) {
            System.out.println("Student found: " + foundStudent.getName());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Student not found.");
        }
    }
}
